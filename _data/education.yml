    During my time at UofM I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork, detail oriantation and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a member of the *Active Living Center* practicing *Boxing*.
