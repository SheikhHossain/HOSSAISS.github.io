    Every company needs their network members satisfied to continue business with them and Skip the Dishes is no exception. I collaborated with my colleague in a fast-paced environment to handle stakeholder concerns. We provided them with tailored solutions according to their needs to better assist them while keeping their information and details confidential. I also worked on different projects to increase productivity, overall performance and helped mentor a lot of new colleagues so they can thrive in their role.
